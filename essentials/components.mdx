Registering React components is what makes them available in the Makeswift builder. The `ReactRuntime.registerComponent` function accepts a `type` to identify the component, a `label` to label it in the Makeswift builder, and `props` to define the [controls](/architecture#controls).

```js
import { ReactRuntime } from "@makeswift/runtime/react"
```

## Breaking changes

### Type

When building visually in the Makeswift builder we save your component's data according to the
registered component's `type` and `props` schema. What this means is that if the `type` changes, the
component won't be recognized and you will see a "Component not found" error.

### Props

If the `props` change in an incompatible way, this might cause runtime errors since the data that
Makeswift will provide your component might not match what your component expects anymore.

We're actively working on building migration tools so that you can migrate component data. For now,
it's a bit of a manual process where a component can be registered with a new `type` and then be
visually replaced in the Makeswift builder. Once all instances of the old component have been
replaced, the old component can be removed.

## Local development

When changing files that call `registerComponent` you've got to do a full refresh so that the
changes can be registered. This is not necessary when changing the component sourceâ€”it's only
necessary when changing a file that calls `registerComponent`.

## Organizing components

As you register more components, finding a specific component in the builder can
become challenging. We've included some features to make finding your components
simpler: **sections**, **icons**, and **search**.

### Sections

Sections are a way to group components in the builder, creating a visual
hierarchy for organizing your components. To create a section hierarchy, simply
incorporate forward slashes (`/`) in the `label` of your component when you
register it.

Let's say you have a `Sphere` component that belongs in a section named
"Visuals". To organize this component, use the label `'Visuals/Sphere'`.
Similarly, if you have another `Cube` component that belongs in the same
"Visuals" section, label it with `'Visuals/Cube'`. In the builder, these
components will now be grouped together under a collapsible section called
Visuals".

For even more organization, you can create multiple sections within the labels
by separating them with slashes. This way, you can create a nested hierarchy
to suit your needs and keep your components neatly organized.

### Icons

For additional visual organization, you can optionally register each of your
components with an icon. Simply import `ComponentIcon` from `@makeswift/runtime`
and select a value from this object as the component's `icon`. The component
will now be displayed in the builder component tray with the icon of your
choosing. If you do not provide an icon, the default cube icon will be
displayed.

These icons are currently accessible via `ComponentIcon`:

<RuntimeIconsGrid />

### Search

You can search for individual components by label using the search bar at the
top of the components tray. If you've used sections to organize your components,
you can search for any part of the component's label, including the names of the
sections it belongs to.
