title: BigCommerce x Catalyst
---

Catalyst is the composable, fully customizable headless ecommerce storefront framework for [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/). Catalyst has been built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/) storefront components, and BigCommerce's [GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql).

When you use Catalyst, you can create a fully functional BigCommerce storefront using their CLI and get to work without wiring up APIs or building ecommerce components from scratch that are optimized for SEO, accessibility, and performance. Catalyst is designed to take care of the essentials so you can focus your efforts on building your brand and adding those special features that take storefronts to the next level.

You can find a demo version of Catalyst at https://catalyst-demo.site/, hosted on Vercel in a US region.

<Warning>
  While Makeswift is a subsidiary of BigCommerce, Catalyst and Makeswift are
  completely decoupled solutions. This is to say that Catalyst and Makeswift can
  be used in conjunction, or independent of one another. While they are separate
  solutions,both are built to be heavily integrated with one another. This guide
  serves as a supplement to the documentation available on [Catalyst's Getting
  Started documentation](https://www.catalyst.dev/docs/monorepo).
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

### 1. Node.js version 20.x

Catalyst currently supports Node.js version 20.x (click here to download Node.js)

### 2. Corepack-enabled pnpm

Node.js version 20.x ships with Corepack by default; you should be able to run corepack enable from your terminal to meet this prerequisite (more information on the official Node.js Corepack documentation)

### 3. Git version 2.35.x or later:

(Click here to download Git)

### 4. A BigCommerce store or sandbox

You can create a trial store or spin up a developer sandbox to meet this prerequisite. If you already have a BigCommerce store, that will work fine too.

### 5. A Makeswift workspace with [locales](locales) enabled/provisioned.

If you have not created a Makeswift workspace, do so ahead of time. The current
version of Catalyst requires Locales to be enabled. Reach out

### 6. Permission to create API accounts on your store

In order to allow Catalyst to authenticate with your BigCommerce store, you'll need to make sure that your user account on the subject store has been granted the Create store-level API Accounts permission detailed in our documentation on High-Risk Permissions. If you are the assigned store owner of the store, you have these permissions implicitly.

### 7. A GitHub account

You can sign up for a free GitHub account on the official GitHub signup page.
