## Builder isn't loading in Safari

If you're using Safari and the builder isn't loading, it's likely that you're running into issues
with [mixed content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/Security/Mixed_content).

Safari blocks loading of all mixed-content resources, which means that `https://app.makeswift.com`,
which is loaded via **HTTPS**, can't load `http://localhost:3000`, which is loaded via **HTTP**.

The solution to this issue is to run your local Next.js app with HTTPS. If you're not familiar with
running your Next.js app locally with HTTPS, we've explained how to do so
in <a href="https://www.makeswift.com/blog/accessing-your-local-nextjs-dev-server-using-https">this blog post</a>.

If you follow the instructions in the blog post, i.e., use `mkcert`, you might need to make sure
that Node.js trusts `mkcert`'s CA. This can be done with the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` env var.

For example, in your `package.json`:

```diff
-    "dev": "next dev",
+    "dev": "NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=\"$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem\" next dev",
```

If you don't make this change you might see an `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` error. Read more in
[this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68135600).

Makeswift checks if your app is running in development and will automatically bypass the SSL proxy,
so you should not encounter this error unless you're running a production build of your Next.js app
or makeswift fails to bypass the SSL proxy for some reason.

## Builder isn't loading in Brave Browser

If you're using Brave and the builder isn't loading, it's likely you're running into issues with
Brave Shields and its restrictions on `localhost`.

After [#463](https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/pull/463) was merged, Brave blocks requests to
`localhost` from non-`localhost` documents.

To solve this issue, go to `brave://adblock` and add the following custom filter:

```
@@||localhost^$domain=app.makeswift.com
```

This will make it so that Brave Shields doesn't block `localhost` requests from `app.makeswift.com`.
