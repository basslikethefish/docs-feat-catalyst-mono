You can integrate a local Next.js app with a MakeswiftÂ site using an automatic or manual setup. You can integrate new or existing Next.js apps; however, we recommend using the [Manual Installation](/guides/manual-installation) guide for existing apps. 

This guide shows you how to set up a Next.js app for a local development environment using an automatic setup. 

# Prerequisites

You will need the following:
- Node.js. For version requirements, see the Next.js [Installation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.
- Experience building Next.js applications.

You don't need an existing Makeswift site to complete this guide. 

# Automatic setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the app">

    Perform the following CLI command.

    ```bash
    npx makeswift@latest init
    ```

    After you confirm you'd like to integrate your app, the CLI generates all the necessary files in the project folder.
  
    The CLI then opens a new page in your browser where you will continue integrating your app.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Next.js app to a Makeswift site">

    The browser will prompt you to select a Makeswift site to connect to your local Next.js app. You may need to login or sign up, but the browser will redirect you to this page.

    <Accordion title="Select an existing site or create a new one.">
      ![Select Site](./images/select-site.png)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Pick a template (optional).">
      ![Select Template](./images/select-template.png)
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="When the Makeswift site is being linked to `localhost`, check the CLI for any prompts.">
      ![Integrating](./images/integrating.png)

      During this step, the Makeswift site API Key is stored as an environment variable inside your local `.env.local` file.
    </Accordion>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    The browser redirects you to Makeswift Builder once the integration is complete. To learn how to use Makeswift builder, see the [Help Center](https://help.makeswift.com/) articles.    
    
    - Make sure the site has at least one page. The toolbar for each page should contain custom components for the template, as shown in the following image:

    ![Custom Components](./images/custom-components.png)

    - You can make your own custom components available in Makeswift builder. For examples on how to register a component, see the [Runtime](/reference/runtime) reference or navigate to the `components` folder in your local Next app.
