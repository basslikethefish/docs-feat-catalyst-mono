You can integrate a local Next.js app with a MakeswiftÂ site using an automatic or manual setup. You can integrate new or existing Next.js apps; however, we recommend using the [manual installation](/guides/manual-installation) guide for existing apps.

This guide shows you how to set up a Next.js app for a local development environment using an automatic setup.

# Prerequisites

You will need the following:

- Node.js. For version requirements, see the Next.js [installation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) guide.
- Familiarity with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)

You don't need an existing Makeswift site to complete this guide.

# Automatic setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the app">

    Perform the following CLI command.

    ```bash
    npx makeswift@latest init
    ```

    After you confirm you'd like to integrate your app, the CLI generates all the necessary files in the project folder.

    The CLI then opens a new page in your browser where you will continue integrating your app.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect the Next.js app to a Makeswift site">

    The browser will prompt you to select a Makeswift site to connect to your local Next.js app. You may need to login or sign up, but the browser will redirect you to this page.


    <Accordion title="Select an existing site or create a new one.">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/select-site.png" alt="Screenshot of select site to integrate" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Pick a template (optional).">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/select-template.png" alt="Screenshot of template picker" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Check CLI while site is being linked.">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/integrating.png" alt="Screenshot of linking page" />
      </Frame>

      During this step, the Makeswift site API Key is stored as an environment variable inside your local `.env.local` file.
    </Accordion>

    <Warning>
      Make sure to check your console during the linking process. If the CLI fails to install dependencies you may need to install them manually.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    The browser redirects you to Makeswift Builder once the integration is complete. If you skipped the template option, make sure to create a page.

    <Accordion title="How do I create a page?">
      <Frame>
        <img src="/images/add-page.png" alt="Screenshot of add page" />
      </Frame>
    </Accordion>

    You should find some new custom components in the toolbar.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/registered-components.png" alt="Screenshot of custom components in toolbar" />
    </Frame>

    These components will be located in the `components` folder of your Next.js app. You can explore the files ending with `.makeswift.ts` to learn more about [registering components](/reference/runtime/register-component).
